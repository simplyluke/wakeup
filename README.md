# Wakeup

Small personal utility to help me get better sleep. Naturally made while procrastinating from both school and sleep.

Sleep cycles are about 90 minutes long, and it takes about 15 minutes to go to sleep. What this code does is it takes the current time and tells you when to get up if you crawl into bed right now.

If you want to install I'd recommend doing something like this.

    chmod +x wakeup.py
    cp wakeup.py /usr/local/bin/wakeup

    wakeup
